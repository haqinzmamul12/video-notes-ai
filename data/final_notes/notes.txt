## Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to perform tasks without being explicitly programmed. This is achieved by feeding data into an algorithm, which gradually improves outcomes with experience.

## Key Concepts
* **Definition**: Machine learning allows computers to learn from data and improve outcomes over time.
* **History**: The term was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel at IBM, who developed artificial intelligence to play checkers.
* **Applications**: Predictive models are embedded in many products, performing two fundamental jobs:
	+ **Classification**: Classifying data, such as detecting objects or diagnosing diseases.
	+ **Prediction**: Making predictions about future outcomes, such as stock prices or recommending videos.

## Machine Learning Process
The machine learning process involves the following steps:
1. **Data Acquisition and Cleaning**: Collecting and preprocessing large amounts of data to ensure it accurately represents the problem.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem.
3. **Data Separation**: Splitting data into:
	+ **Training Set**: Used to build a model.
	+ **Testing Set**: Used to validate the accuracy or error of the model.
4. **Algorithm Selection**: Choosing an algorithm, such as:
	+ **Statistical Models**: Linear or logistic regression.
	+ **Decision Trees**: Assigning weights to features.
	+ **Convolutional Neural Networks**: Assigning weights to features and creating additional features automatically.

## Algorithm Types
* **Simple Statistical Models**: Linear or logistic regression.
* **Decision Trees**: Assigning weights to features.
* **Convolutional Neural Networks**: Useful for datasets with images or natural language, where manual feature engineering is challenging.

## Key Takeaways
* Machine learning enables computers to learn from data and improve outcomes over time.
* The quality of the data is crucial for achieving accurate results.
* Choosing the right algorithm depends on the specific problem and dataset.

## Machine Learning Overview
#### Key Points:
* Machine learning algorithms learn from data, such as images or natural language, without manual feature engineering.
* These algorithms improve by comparing predictions to an error function.
* Error functions vary depending on the problem type:
  + Classification: accuracy
  + Regression: mean absolute error
#### Popular Tools and Languages:
* Python: primary language among data scientists
* R and Julia: also popular options
* Various supporting frameworks available
#### Machine Learning Process:
1. Train a model on input data
2. Model outputs predictions to minimize error
3. Deploy the model to a device or cloud for real-world applications
#### Outcome:
* A trained model file that takes input data and generates predictions to minimize error.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
* Learn features through layers, with early layers learning basic features like edges and later layers learning more complex features.
* Process visual data through convolutional and pooling layers, and fully connected layers for classification.
* Break down images into smaller features, such as a car image being broken into smaller parts and filters.
* Can be applied to image and text data
* Typically consist of convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers
* Output a probability distribution over classes via a softmax function

## Model Evaluation
* Accuracy score function is used to evaluate the accuracy of a classification model
* Models can incorrectly identify objects with high confidence (e.g., identifying a dog as a cat with 92% confidence)

## Popular Libraries
* NumPy, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and pandas are used in AI and machine learning applications

## Code Snippet

  + Date
  + Rotation
  + Venue
  + Team
  + Scores
